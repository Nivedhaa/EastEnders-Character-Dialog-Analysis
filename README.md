# EastEnders Character Dialog Analysis
This project provides a Python program for creating vector-based representations of dialogues spoken by each character in scripts from the long-standing UK television series, EastEnders.

## Overview
The Python program begins with a baseline system and proceeds to generate vector-based representations for all dialogues in the series. The primary aim is to encapsulate the semantic information carried by each character's lines in the form of a vector, which can be used for various Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Functionality
The primary functionality of this program is to perform a basic Information Retrieval task - finding the most similar document vector in the held-out and test data compared to a training vector document. This is done by comparing the cosine similarity of the vectors. The mean rank metric is used to evaluate the performance of this retrieval task.
